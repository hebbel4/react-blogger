# React Redux Blogger

This is a blog website where users can add and delete their posts by navigating through different webpages.

* Applied React Router to render different components according to different urls
* Applied validation on redux forms to avoid mallicious input (eg. to display an error message when user didn't enter anything in a field but want to submit the form)
* Added redirecting button/Link on the webpage to let user navigate through different webpages
* Used Axios library to fetch, post, save, and delete posts using remote backend API (Redux Blog Post API)
